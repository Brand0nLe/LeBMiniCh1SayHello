# Project will store the user's input for their name and print it back out to them in the terminal. If user enters in numbers it will display a message to have them enter in their real name. Has the ability to play again.

I like the program! It runs as intended, and I appreciate the compliment on how beautiful my name is lol. I also like the fact that Ken is then included into the conversation. I was a bit confused when it looped, but I now understand that when it loops, it's because you said you have time to talk to Ken.
